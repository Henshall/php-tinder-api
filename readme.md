# PHP Tinder API
## Version: 1.0.0

This is a PHP package for Tinders (Match Group, Inc.) API. 

Tinders API is private - and there is not very much information on the internet about how to access or use it.
I have used chromes networking tab to examine Tinder xhr requests to create this API - it contains some methods found
no where else on the internet - including verion 3's sms authentication requests (new as of the last month of writing).

Additionally - you will find lots of examples as well as tips and trick, common mistakes while using, and more. 

## Installation with Composer:
```bash
composer require henshall/php-tinder-api
```

## Pre-requisites
- Create a Tinder Account (https://tinder.com/)
